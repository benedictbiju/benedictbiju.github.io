    <h1>The Rise of AI Coding Assistants: Are Developers Still Needed in 2025?</h1>

    <p>
        In 2025, AI coding assistants have become more advanced than ever. Tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and SourceAI now write entire functions, 
        generate full applications, and even debug code automatically. This rapid growth has raised a big question: 
        <strong>are human developers still necessary?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        The simple answer is yes — developers are still essential. AI can write code, but it cannot fully replace creative problem solving, 
        system architecture thinking, or real-world experience. Developers who understand how to design software and guide AI tools are more 
        productive than ever before.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead of replacing programmers, AI has become a powerful assistant. It handles repetitive work, boilerplate code, 
        documentation, and error correction. This allows developers to focus on planning, logic, security, and performance.
    </p>

    <p>
        In fact, companies now prefer developers who know how to work with AI tools. The future belongs to engineers who can combine 
        human creativity with the speed of AI.
    </p>

    <p>
        As we move forward, development is becoming less about writing code manually and more about thinking, designing, and managing 
        intelligent systems. Developers are not disappearing — they’re evolving.
